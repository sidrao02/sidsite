Internships:

Egyptian Art Caravan:
During the summer of 2019, I had the opportunity to intern for an Orlando based company called Egyptian Art Caravan which sells Ancient Egypt-themed items, such as papyruses and sculptures. I worked for their social media manager. My role was to design images and create captions for the company’s social media posts to promote their products. This internship was special, as it taught me important career skills like team work, collaborating with remote team members, working with deadlines, and above all getting exposure to social media marketing. I could fully utilize my skills as a graphic designer and was very excited to find out that my artwork had the maximum “likes” amongst all the interns.

T’s 4Hope: 
Starting in the summer of 2019, I took up a second internship at T’s 4Hope, which sells t-shirts with inspirational messages and donates a portion of the proceeds to the homeless and hungry. There, I created several t-shirt designs, and was very happy that I could utilize my skills as a graphic designer to contribute to a great cause.

High school clubs and groups:

High school Wind Ensemble:
Selected as a clarinetist in the High School Wind Ensemble in the sophomore year after rounds of tryouts. We play in concerts and compete against other school bands throughout the state.
Time spent: 42 weeks per school year, 4-6 hours per week

High school Varsity Tennis Team
Selected in the High School varsity tennis team in the freshman year after rigorous tryouts. We practice and play matches against other school teams throughout the state almost every day of the season. Unfortunately, I had to drop off from the team after my sophomore year after fracturing my wrist while practicing with my team.

Through NHS, I have had various opportunities to volunteer for community service, spread awareness for cancer, community unity walks, and tutoring other students. 
Time spent: 42 weeks per school year, 0-7 hours per week

Social Studies Honor Society
Social Studies Honors Society is a club for students who have done well in Social Studies courses throughout their high school years. Discussions amongst the club members really helped me explore, appreciate, and expand my understanding of Social Studies. Like any other club, SSHS involved a lot of volunteering and fundraising. More importantly, however, we organized multiple activities such as decorating our school for Black History month.

Political Science Club
The Political Science Club is a club for people who are interested in politics and the direction that our country is heading. In this club we learn about politics and political decisions. There is some fundraising involved, but we also organize a lot of interesting events. For example, political leaders from across our state come in to speak with us about their vision and campaigns and we have weekly debates on issues concerning our town. 

Community service:
Over 80 hours of voluntary service through East Brunswick Youth Council. East Brunswick Youth Council is an organization which brings together students from our town to help the community.  As a member of the vibrant East Brunswick Youth council, I volunteered for a variety of community service events assisting kids and senior citizens.
