I have been playing tennis for 7 years now. Finally, it is my freshman year and I now had the opportunity to try out for the High school tennis team. Tryouts were definitely competitive and we had to play in temperatures under 10 Â°  Fahrenheit. These horrid temperatures definitely effected my game. However, I persevered and was ultimately able to make the team!
