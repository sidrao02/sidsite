# Coding my own game from scratch
## June 11th, 2020
I recently took the opportunity of taking an advanced Java course from the Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth. It was a great college experience. However, the highlight of my time was when I was able to create my own game. I was not allowed to copy any code from online. After one and a half weeks , I was able to recreate the Atari game, Boxing. I was extremely happy how this turned out. If you want to play this game I created here is the link for the download: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1JYyAdvfbZBZTqG8aTXZdLZ_0cLWu_8g2/view?usp=sharing
