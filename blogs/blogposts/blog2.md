Over the past few days, I have been working with an eBay retailer called Dirty Underground. They wanted a totally different look for their online store: a new logo, a new profile picture, and a new banner. This was my first time working with a business of their caliber (over 1000 orders). It was a paid deal and I was nervous that my work wouldn't be so professional as they would have thought. I spent almost 4 hours working for them and sent their requested graphics. Fortunately, they really liked what I made and I got a lot of money for it.
